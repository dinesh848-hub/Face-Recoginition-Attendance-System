### How it's works

The system works on face recognition where each student in the class is photographed and their details are stored in a server. The teacher can then record the attendance by just clicking some pictures of the classroom. The system will recognize the faces and verify the presence or absence of each student.

####  Project Definition  
Design  of an automatic attendance system using face detection . The system requires a video capturing device which continuously detects the face of attendees and mark them as present if present in the database.  
 ### Project Objectives  

1. Reducing time wastage duringtraditional class attendance  2. Automatically creates a file containing the name of attendees 3. Preventing the proxy during class attendance 4. Utilizing the latest trend of machine vision  


###  Software Used   

1. pycharm for python 
2. 2. MYSQL connector Database  



### Python Libraries Used  
1. CV2  - OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays.  
2. Numpy - NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.  
3. face_recognition - Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world’s simplest face recognition library. Built using dlib‘s state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.
